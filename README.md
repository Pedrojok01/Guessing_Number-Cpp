# Guessing_Number_C++

My Guessing Number game with a few extra features added, written in C++.


How To Play:
============

1/ Player 1 must input a number from 0 to 9999. 
Please note that 4 Characters are required! So for example, if you want your number to be 50, you must enter: "0050", 584 would be "0584", etc.

2/ Then, player 2 can start guessing player 1 number in as little attempts as possible. Input your guess and press Enter. Be sure to enter an integer or you might regret it...

3/ If you want to play again, enter 'y' or 'Y' when the prompt tells you to do so. Enter any other key to exit the program.
