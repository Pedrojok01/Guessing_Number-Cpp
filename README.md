# Guessing_Number_C++

My Guessing Number game with a few extra features added, written in C++.

> Note: </br>Due to the use of the old conio.h library, this program was developed to work on windows OS. I've added a Mac & Linux version which should work in an almost identical way. For the best experience, please choose the right version according to your OS.


How To Play:
============

1/ Player 1 must input a number from 0 to 9999. 
Please note that 4 Characters are required! So for example, if you want your number to be 50, you must enter: `0050`, 584 would be `0584`, etc.

2/ Then, player 2 can start guessing player 1 number in as little attempts as possible. Input your guess and press `Enter`. Be sure to enter an integer or you might regret it...

3/ If you want to play again, enter `y` or `Y` when the prompt tells you to do so. Enter any other key to exit the program.


Features:
=========

- Player 1's number is hidden while typing (password-like input) ;
- Only Integers are allowed, both from player 1 & 2 ;
- Counter keeping tracks of attempts's number ;
- "Play again or quit" option at the end ;
